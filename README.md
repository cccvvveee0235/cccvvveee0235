[brief introduction]

Over the past four years as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, I have honed my skills in identifying, investigating, and mitigating cybersecurity threats. My experience encompasses a broad range of responsibilities, from monitoring security events and alerts in real-time using advanced SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools, to conducting detailed analysis to understand the nature and scope of threats.
